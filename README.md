# plotCC
 There is no standard package (to the best of my knowledge) to create those traditional graphics of mathematical functions using Cartesian Coordinate system with the origem (0,0) or (0,0,0) in the right place. Here you find functions that extends the base plot functionalities and generate such plots. Use the source files and the script example.R to produce the graphics.
